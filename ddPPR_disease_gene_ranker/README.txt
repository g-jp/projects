This pipeline described an algorithm used to rank genes in disease based on experimental MS data. It expands an experimental interactome module based on a gene-associated-disease network to capture relevant genes that might me dysregulated or have causal relationships with a given phenotype in disease. The pipeline was originally used to compare interactome results of membrane WT- vs. F508del-CFTR to retrieve possible causal genes in known phenotypes of rescued F508del-CFTR, as well as possible dysregulated genes that might be associated with disease progress in CF, such as exacerbated inflammation. 

The pipeline consists of 1) generating a disease-associated network of protein-protein interactions that will be used for the downstream diffusion and ranking of genes and 2) the actual diffusion algorithm consisting of a comparative Personalized Page Rank that contrast two MS/MS interactome data for WT- and F508del-CFTR as the seed set of each diffusion round for the same network, depicting which genes seem to be most differentially associated with one interactome relative to the other.
